---

Description

- 2 Layer PCB.
- The board and tracks should be suitable for carrying 3V - 24V DC power.
- All JST headers should be 2.54 dot pitch.

The following should be on the board:

- A 30 pin male IDC connector header
- A 10 pin IDC connector header
- A row of 30 pins suitable for connecting jumper cables to.
- A row of 10 pins suitable for connecting jumper cables to.

- Two more rows of 32 pins suitable for connecting jumper cables to.
  - Each of the pins should have tracks wired to the following:

- 7x 2 pin JST headers
- 5x 3 pin JST headers
- 6x 4 pin JST headers
- 1x 5 pin JST headers
- A 2 pin wire-to-board screw down connector.

The 2 pin wire to board connector should have tracks running to 4x male pins (2 for each hole), this will be used for the hot-end wires and suitable for slightly higher current (3A at 24V) and run to a two pin connector with screws so that wires can be manually connected.
