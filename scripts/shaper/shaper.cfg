These macros are meant to simplify and automate the shaper calibration process.

They performs the following steps:

- Home the printer (if needed)
- Calibrate the shapers
- Generate the graph images
- Save the recommended shaper settings to your config

## Installation

### Prerequisites

First, install the [gcode_shell_command extension](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh/blob/master/docs/gcode_shell_command.md). 

The easiest way to do so is using [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh).

### Macros and Scripts

Next create a `shaper` folder in your `~/printer_data/config` directory.

Download the following to that `~/printer_data/config/shaper/` directory:

- [ADXL_SHAPER.cfg](ADXL_SHAPER.cfg)
- [adxl_shape_x.sh](adxl_shape_x.sh)
- [adxl_shape_y.sh](adxl_shape_y.sh)

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

You need to have you ADXL or MPU accelerometers for both axis and a `test_resonances` section configured for this to work.

> If you are able to measure both axis from a single accelerometer then you only need the one.

The [ADXL_SHAPER.cfg](ADXL_SHAPER.cfg) file contains a `[respond]` line. This is necessary for sending feedback in the console.

However, if you already have that section elsewhere in your config then you can safely comment out or delete it here.

### Include Config

Add the following line to your `printer.cfg` file near the top:

    [include shaper/ADXL_SHAPER.cfg]

## Usage

Simply run one of the following:

- `ADXL_SHAPE_ALL` to calibrate both axis
- `ADXL_SHAPE_X` to calibrate only the X axis
- `ADXL_SHAPE_Y` to calibrate only the Y axis

No parameters are needed.
