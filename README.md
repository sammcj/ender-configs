# Sam's Ender Configs

My Documentation, Configuration, Scripts and notes for my Ender 5 S1 and Ender 3 v2 Neo printers.

## Ender 3 v2 Neo

- [ender-3-v2-neo](ender-3-v2-neo/README.md)

## RockPi 4 SE

- [rockpi](rockpi/README.md)

### Connectivity

- Klipper/Mainsail/Fluidd running on a RockPi 4 SE
- Webcam connected to RockPi with ustreamer
- Printer connected via USB
  - I did try removing the USB 5v pin as per <https://community.octoprint.org/t/put-tape-on-the-5v-pin-why-and-how/13574> but it caused the printer to not be detected, I ended up getting an adapter that removes the 5v pin cleanly.
  - udev rules for consistent USB device naming - when you reconnect a USB device it might get a different device name (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` > `/dev/ttyUSB1` etc...) - this is annoying if you've configured your software such as Octoprint to use a specific device. As such you can create udev rules to ensure both the printer and any related webcams are always named consistently (e.g. `/dev/3dprinter`, `/dev/webcam` etc...) [octoprint/`99-3d-printer.rules`](octoprint/99-3d-printer.rules).

### Formatting SD Cards

Make sure you format your SD card with 4096 byte sector size or it may not flash correctly.

Format a SDCard with 4096 byte sector size in macOS

```shell
diskutil list # Find the SDCard you want to format

diskutil info disk4s1 # Get the current SDCard info, assuming the disk is disk4s1
sudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -b 4096 disk4s1 # Format the SDCard as FAT32 with a 4096 byte sector size, assuming the disk is disk4s1
```
