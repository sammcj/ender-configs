# Sam's Ender 3 V2 Neo Setup

## Hardware

- Ender 3 v2 Neo

### Upgrades

- SKR Mini E3 V3
- Orbiter 2.0 Extruder
  - Orbiter 2.0 Filament Loader and Sensor
- Creality Spider Hotend (Titan kit version)
- Drive drive
- Dual Z Axis

  - 1x 4020 Fan for the hotend
  - 1x 80mm Fan for the PSU
- Replaced Neo X carriage mount with the Ender 3 V2 direct drive mount

#### Future Upgrades

Potential future upgrades

- [Squirrelf](https://t.co/BVAAPdqH7z)'s ApolloLander cooling <https://www.patreon.com/posts/apollolander-and-71090737>
- Klipper - Currently I'm using Marlin but I'm interested in trying Klipper
- ADXL345 accelerometer
- Belt driven Z Axis - <https://github.com/kevinakasam/BeltDrivenEnder3>
- Linear rails (expensive though!)

#### Previous Upgrades

I'm no longer using these upgrades, but I'm keeping them here for reference.

- E3D/Creality Titan Extruder
- Hero Me Gen 7
- Spider 1.0 Hot End

### Connectivity

- Klipper/Mainsail/Fluidd running on a RockPi 4 SE
- Webcam connected to RockPi with ustreamer
- Printer connected via USB
  - I did try removing the USB 5v pin as per <https://community.octoprint.org/t/put-tape-on-the-5v-pin-why-and-how/13574> but it caused the printer to not be detected, I ended up getting an adapter that removes the 5v pin cleanly.
  - udev rules for consistent USB device naming - when you reconnect a USB device it might get a different device name (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` > `/dev/ttyUSB1` etc...) - this is annoying if you've configured your software such as Octoprint to use a specific device. As such you can create udev rules to ensure both the printer and any related webcams are always named consistently (e.g. `/dev/3dprinter`, `/dev/webcam` etc...) [octoprint/`99-3d-printer.rules`](octoprint/99-3d-printer.rules).

## Firmware

I have settled on using @mriscoc's Firmware for the Ender 3 V2.

It is based on the Marlin firmware but has a number of optimisations for the Ender 3 V2 Neo and is well suited to Octoprint.

- [mriscoc/Ender3V2S1](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1)
- [How to install the firmware](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1/wiki/How-to-install-the-firmware)

Note: To store the mesh and other settings on the printer you must leave a SD plugged in, otherwise when you restart the printer it will return to the firmware defaults.

### Custom Firmware Further Customisations

- See [firmware](firmware/README.md)

### Formatting SD Cards

Make sure you format your SD card with 4096 byte sector size or it may not flash correctly.

Format a SDCard with 4096 byte sector size in macOS

```shell
diskutil list # Find the SDCard you want to format

diskutil info disk4s1 # Get the current SDCard info, assuming the disk is disk4s1
sudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -b 4096 disk4s1 # Format the SDCard as FAT32 with a 4096 byte sector size, assuming the disk is disk4s1
```

## Settings

- Bed size (printable)
  - X: 225mm
  - Y: 225mm
- Bed size (max)
  - X: 244mm
  - Y: 230mm

## Creality Spider - Titan Version (2023)

The Spider hot end that comes with the Titan extruder kit is a bit different from the v1 and v3 spider.

Note: The carriage plate pictured here is NOT the Neo version! It's from a Ender 3 v2 (non-neo).

### Octoprint

_Note: I'm in the process of switching from OctoPrint + Marlin to Klipper + Mainsail / Fluidd with [kiauh](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh)._

- Historical octoprint [octoprint/docker-compose.yml](legacy/octoprint/docker-compose.yml) NO LONGER USED.

## Failed print recovery

I've created a GCODE template that can be used to recover/resume from a failed print.

- See [legacy/gcodes/manual-print-recovery.gcode](legacy/gcodes/manual-print-recovery.gcode)
